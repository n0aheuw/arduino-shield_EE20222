Arduino Shield EE20222
=======

Arduino Shield EE20222 is a coding project for the Arduino UNO where
we designed a PCB with three seperate sensors to test for temperature,
light and acceleration. 

We used a HIH6120, TSL257 and a Adafruit MMA8451.

I have uploaded my code to demonstrate how I implemented my code please do not just copy and paste it for your project you will get caught.
Use my code to guide you if you wish but try figure it out.
